## Workflowr setup
# LIFE4138 Practical

# clear your environment
rm(list = ls())

# install and load workflowr
# install.packages("workflowr")
library(workflowr)

# configure git - only necessary once
wflow_git_config(user.name = "username", 
                 user.email = "user@email.com", overwrite = TRUE)
# replace username and user email with your own!


# Start a workflowr project
wflow_start("myworkflowr_test")
# nb this will create a directory within your working directory

# build the site
wflow_build()

# check the status
wflow_status()

# publish the website and all files
wflow_publish(files = "analysis/*.Rmd", message = "Publish initial files for my project")

# check workflow status again
wflow_status()

# put code on github
wflow_use_github("username")
# replace with your own
# when prompted fwith a choice, choose 1 and in your browser, choose to allow R to access github

# push code to github - dry run just allows you to see what code will do
wflow_git_push(dry_run = TRUE)
wflow_git_push()
# nb - this might not actually work via R so you will need to open a terminal, navigate to your
# working directory and type 'git push -u origin master'
